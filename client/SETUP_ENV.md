# Client Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

This file is already created, but if you need to recreate it, copy the content above.

The `.env` file tells React where to find your backend API.
